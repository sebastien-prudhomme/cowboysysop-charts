updates: |
  ### Upgrading to version 7.0.0

  The chart now uses forked versions of the Bitnami charts to reference the Bitnami Legacy repository:

  - https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267

  A label `app.kubernetes.io/component` will be added to the Deployment. Run this command before upgrading to prevent an immutable field error:

  ```bash
  $ kubectl delete deployment/my-kubeview-deployment
  ```

  Pod and container security contexts are now configured with default values.

  Information about services are no more injected into pod's environment variable.

  ### Upgrading to version 5.0.0

  The chart is now tested with Kubernetes >= 1.24 and Helm >= 3.9.

  Future upgrades may introduce undetected breaking changes if you continue to use older versions.

  ### Upgrading to version 4.0.0

  Some parameters related to port management have been modified:

  - Parameter `service.port` has been renamed `service.ports.http`.
  - Parameter `service.nodePort` has been renamed `service.nodePorts.http`.

  ### Upgrading to version 3.0.0

  Some parameters related to image management have been modified:

  - Registry prefix in `image.repository` parameters is now configured in `image.registry`.
  - Parameter `imagePullSecrets` has been renamed `global.imagePullSecrets`.

  ### Upgrading to version 2.0.0

  The chart is no more compatible with Helm 2.

  Refer to the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/) for more information.
